# Data Analytics Portfolio
- This repository serves as a showcase of my expertise in various data science tools. It features projects completed using public datasets that address real business problems, demonstrating my skills and capabilities.

# Professional Projects Summary :
- Below is a list of projects I completed for my employer. While I cannot provide the actual data due to sensitivity and data security concerns, I can explain the concepts behind each project. 
# 1. Volume Forecasting
This project focused on forecasting the inflow volume for a specific process across various parts of the Earth, considering different combinations of ports, countries, and continents. The outcome of the project included:

- Planning the required resources for this process using volume forecasting, with the best-case scenario requiring a variance of +/-1 full-time equivalent (FTE) for one continent and the worst-case scenario requiring a variance of +/-3 FTE for one continent.
- Improving quality promises and ensuring delivery on time.

# 2.Chatbot for Process assistance
In organizations, users who have undergone training are often mentored and may ask their mentors for clarification on processes. However, mentors' understanding of the process can vary, leading to inconsistencies. 

- To address this, a chatbot was built using basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods and deployed with a user interface created using Tkinter. 
- The outcome of this model was a reduction in variation in understanding the process, as the chatbot provided consistent and accurate information to users.
